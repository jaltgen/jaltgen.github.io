This page needed an overhaul. I changed my job, so I thought, I'd take the time to change my website. Here you will find a simplified presence where I will put stuff I work on as well as my occasional original content. I have a new ebook in the works, but that will take a few months to get ready. In the meantime, I can recomment my first ebook, as well as the entries in the knowledge base.

Thanks for checking this page out. You can reach me [email](mailto:jannik@indiecolorgrading.com).
