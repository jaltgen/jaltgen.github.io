1. Involve us early & fast
  - talk about the looks you want
  - talk about the gear you shoot with
  - get us to talk to the other post-team
  - get some suggestions
3. We will honor your creative choices
  - mostly.
  - it's about helping you look the best, not have the best look
4. But still improve stuff, not because you're a bad DP though
  - that one time you didn't have enought time to get the fill perfect
  - that annoying gradient on the wall you couldn't get because production ran out of scrims

Last year I was fortunate enough to spend eight months in Australia. I absolutely loved the place and the people and begun friendships that I hope will last a lifetime. I spent four months at Queensland University of Technolog (LINK!) in Brisbane taking part in their film program. The first question everyone asked was of course "And what do you specialize in?" I kept saying I did color grading and would be excited for a chance to grade a few projects. It turned out, QUT had literally nobody who was really into grading, neither students nor staff. This left me in the  situation that a number of productions wanted to get me on board as their colorist. I was excited.

As the productions began to roll out, I got talking with the DPs. Much to my surprise, they were pretty much in the dark about all things color grading, digital imaging, codecs, gamma, etc. Not a single person had ever thought them about what sLog 2 was on their Sony camera. Most staff actually had no clue themselves and were, rather disappointingly, very closed minded about allowing their students to experiment. In response, we students huddled together to push our projects through grading and some higher-end workflows despite QUT blocking our paths. Over the course of four months, we put up a sort of color grading rebellion.

The biggest push was to begin shooting in sLog2, Sony's older "flat" gamma curve (sLog3 being the new one LINK!). After tenderly suggesting this to QUT staff we were told it was a no-go due to the new Avid super-hyper-interlinked server-backuped badass production system QUT bought for a $$$. The statement was "sLog produces larger files and we can't put those through the pipeline". We had to call BS on that. *Given a certain framerate, codec, image size and bit-depth, changing the gamma curve will not alter the size of the files.* On a second note, isn't it kind of ridiculous that a modern integrated post production system made by Avid supposedly can't handle a ten-year old gamma curve? *facepalm*.

But wait, the fun continues. The administrator of the bespoke Avid system informed us that any sLog footage in DNxHD codec submitted into the Avid would be deleted automatically. Only XDCAM50 footage could be put in the linking server thingy (bare with me, I'm not going to look up the product names). XDCAM 50 is so old a codec, it's almost older than me. It was used in digital tape recording cameras. Welcome to the Nineties. Transcoding into XDCAM50 and mastering in that codec would have wrecked the quality of the film.

This being ridiculous in itself did not change the fact that we could not put our original footage into the Avid system. However, that was a requirement to get the projects edited, because all editing needed to be done in Avid *and* had to be checked into Interplay (I think that's what it's called). What was allowed, however, was keeping local copies of the sLog camera originals on the workstations that we edited on. That called for a proxy workflow. Edit on non-sLog XDCAM50 proxies, relink to local versions of the sLog DNxHD files later. Yeeeha!

At this point, we refrained from asking QUT and just went out and did it even though we figured we'd be walked over the plank (check expression) for mutiny if anyone found out. We did pull the workflow off flawlessly though, the editors and producers were delighted and we had pulled of a cool workflow that solved a ridiculous institutional problem. With the edit done, the task now fell to me and DP Josh Hanson (LINK!) to deliver a grade.

This story about how we had to establish color grading at QUT is really crucial since as we were struggling to get grading, I pondered a lot about my relationsip with cinematographers. Together with Josh Hanson, the DP of the single project I ended up grading, I went on a journey to discover how to build and establish a working relationship with a cinematographer I had not worked with before. Quickly, we began developing a relationship of creative partnership that turned out to be extremely rewarding for both of us.

From this experience, I boiled the task of the colorist down to this: to make the film look its best. Not put the best look on it. Those are two extremely different things! Colorists should not try to impose their own sense of style on a film. It is not up to the colorist to go wild and reframe every shot because she thinks she knows better than the DP. The task is to take the footage as it was shot and finesse it. Tweaking each shot on its own and in relation to the others, matching and thus creating a seamless viewing experience, that is what colorists do. Yes, at the end, we can put on a look, but that is really the last (and arguably the easiest) part. Actually, adapting looks has been automized by researchers to the point that an algorithm can slap on looks (LINK!) So really, a look should be the last thing we sell ourselves with.

Here are a few examples of how a colorist can make a shot shine. You remember that day where nothing worked, you were hours behind schedule and just didn't have the time to perfect the fill on your wildly good-looking talent? (Picture) We can make it perfect in grading. Or when you couldn't create that gradient on the back-wall because the production just didn't have another flag and C-stand? Yup, can do that as well. Or that one time shooting outside and the weather changed? Mate, we got you covered.

Color grading is about taking the DPs creative vision and extending upon it. Enhancing the footage to look its best, maximizing the impact of the film. That's what it is really about. A colorist is not someone with a book full of looks for you to pick one from. I like to think of myself as the DPs best friend who can straighten things that went haywire during a stressfull day of production and beyond that, make the film sparkle. It is all about working as a creative team, just the same as the DP would with his gaffer or with the art department. I find the notion that DPs have to reclaim color grading for fear of loosing creative control ridiculous. If directors reclaimed the entire film making process to maintain creative control, no films would ever be produced again.

From my experience at QUT, coming in as an unknown factor and not knowing the people I was going to work with, I would boil it down to two things:

1. Talk to colorists early on.

Meet and talk to them, get to know them. Look at their previous work and figure out if you think you can achieve a common creative goal. You will spend a lot of time together so try to pick a colorist you can see yourself pulling through rough patches with. And they may just know a little something about the camera you will be shooting with. Invite suggestions. Also regarding workflow. Let them talk to editors and punch out a detailed and *rehearsed* workflow for post production. The same goes for VFX people. Talk about what you plan to do and practice your workflows - don't commit blindly to something you read on the internet.

2. Be honest about your expectations, fears and wishes.

It's just like your magical first time with him/her. Tell them what you think should be happening, where you ultimately want to end up and also, honestly, what you are afraid of. Set a common goal, sit back, and relax.

In the future, I want to punch out a few more of these "What should X know about working with a colorist" articles. Please leave your suggestion of who *X* should be and of course, let me know if you liked / hated / despised the article as a whole ;)
