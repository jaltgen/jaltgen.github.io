My name is Jannik C. Altgen, but you can call me Chris. 

*My mission here is to help create amazing visuals using efficient and effective digital cinema workflows from start to finish.*

Can I be there for you all the way:
- in preproduction, choosing and tuning gear?
- on set, when you worry about exposure or safe media storage?
- in the cozy darkness of the grading suite, finalizing it all?

Let's create our next big thing, together.

## Core Values

Self-improvement and honesty are ideals that shape my work. If there's something new to learn, I will dive right in. Beating around the bush isn't my way: I don't like spinning tales, but saying it like it is.

What else do you need?
