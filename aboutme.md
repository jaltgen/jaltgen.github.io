My name is Jannik C. Altgen, but you can call me Chris. 

*My mission here is to help create amazing visuals using efficient and effective digital cinema workflows from start to finish.*

Can I be there for you all the way:
- in preproduction, choosing and tuning gear?
- on set, when you worry about exposure or safe media storage?
- in the cozy darkness of the grading suite, finalizing it all?

Let's create our next big thing, together.

## Core Values

We work best when we communicate openly as equals, no politics, no schemes and plots. Meditation, yoga, reading and writing are routines that help me focus my life and work on what is truly important.

What else do you need?
