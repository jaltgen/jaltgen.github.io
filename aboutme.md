My name is Jannik C. Altgen, but you can call me Chris. 

*My passion is creating amazing visuals using efficient and well-managed workflows.*

A background in programming, IT management studies and work as a camera assistant, cutter and colorist gives me a broad perspective on creating and executing digital cinema production workflows. 

My core skills:

- colorgrading on DaVinci Resolve 
- editing in PremierePro and Avid
- IT admin including servers, networks and Win / Mac / Linux clients
- programmer

What else do you need?

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
