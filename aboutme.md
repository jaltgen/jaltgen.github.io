My name is Jannik C. Altgen, but you can call me Chris. 

*My mission here is to help create amazing visuals using efficient and effective digital cinema workflows from start to finish.*

I want to be there in preproduction, when you are wondering which camera to use. If you worry about exposure on set, I want to be there for you. And when we sit in the cozy darkness of the grading suite, I want to be there to finish our greates work yet. If you love crafting stunning images as much as I, why don't we do this together?

Self-improvement and honesty are core values that keep me moving forwards. If there's something new to learn, I will dive right in. Something I don't subscribe to is politics. If there's an issue, let's talk about it and not sweep it under the rug. 



What else do you need?

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
